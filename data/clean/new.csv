These NTAs were selected as they capture neighborhoods that met several criteria for the initiative. They are densely populated and growing neighborhoods where there are higher-than-average concentrations of poverty as measured through the 2010 US Census, and they contain parks that are suitable for recreational redevelopment and received less than $250,000 in capital investment from 1992-2013."
