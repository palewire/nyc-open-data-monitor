In New York City, the fiscal year begins on July 1st of one calendar year and ends on June 30th of the following calendar year. Click here to find out more about the NYC Fiscal Year. Parking Violations Issuance datasets contain violations issued during the respective fiscal year. The Issuance datasets are not updated to reflect violation status, the information only represents the violation(s) at the time they are issued. Since appearing on an issuance dataset, a violation may have been paid, dismissed via a hearing, statutorily expired, or had other changes to its status. To see the current status of outstanding parking violations, please look at the Open Parking & Camera Violations dataset. <b>NOTE:</b> This dataset includes the records from the first month of FY2024. You may find all of the Parking Violations Issued since fiscal year 2014 in this dataset collection."

'Dewatered solids' are the solids remaining in digested sludge after removal of water in a dewatering facility. 'Biosolids', per the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is treated sewage sludge that meets the EPA pollutant, pathogen & vector attraction requirements for land application and surface disposal, and the DEP has certified it with the EPA as such. Biosolids in this case are also dewatered. Depending on the material being managed (i.e., dewatered solids or biosolids), a 'management practice site' may be one of the following: 1) a third party vendor treatment facility (e.g., composting, dryer, alkaline treatment) that converts the dewatered solids into biosolids for beneficial reuse in various land application practices (e.g., agricultural land application, reclamation site application) or for distribution/marketing as a soil amendment or fertilizer; 2) a direct land application site for agricultural use (typically a farm); or 3) a landfill. The dataset includes the pathogen (disease-causing organism) reduction and vector (an animal capable of transmitting disease such as flies or rodents) attraction reduction options employed as part of the treatment and the type of biosolids class produced, if applicable. There are different biosolids class types, each having specified treatment requirements for pollutants, pathogens and vector attraction reduction, as well as general requirements and management practices, For more information regarding biosolids compliance, treatment, uses and class types please refer to: <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/biosolids"">https://www.epa.gov/biosolids</a>."
