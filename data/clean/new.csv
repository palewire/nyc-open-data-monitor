Financial information and agency schedule details for each project are joined via FMS ID. Only projects in the design phase or later have project schedules displayed. Note: Each row is uniquely identified by its Financial Management Service (FMS) ID. FMS ID is the unique ID that OMB uses for the FMS (Financial Information System). This ID can be universally joined with any OMB dataset that has the same field. The Capital Projects Dashboard is the result of joining OMB’s fiscal data with the agency’s schedule data. FMS IDs and agency projects don't always have a one-to-one relationship (ie. one project schedule may correlate to multiple FMS IDs, and one FMS may correct to multiple projects with different schedules)."
