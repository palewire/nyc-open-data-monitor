In New York City, the fiscal year begins on July 1st of one calendar year and ends on June 30th of the following calendar year. Click here to find out more about the NYC Fiscal Year. Parking Violations Issuance datasets contain violations issued during the respective fiscal year. The Issuance datasets are not updated to reflect violation status, the information only represents the violation(s) at the time they are issued. Since appearing on an issuance dataset, a violation may have been paid, dismissed via a hearing, statutorily expired, or had other changes to its status. To see the current status of outstanding parking violations, please look at the Open Parking &amp; Camera Violations dataset. &lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; This dataset includes the records from the first month of FY2024. You may find all of the Parking Violations Issued since fiscal year 2014 in this dataset collection.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">869v-vr48</guid><category>City Government</category><pubDate>Tue, 14 Nov 2023 14:55:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>PMMR Performance Indicators FY2013-15 (Historical Data)</title><link>https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/n6uf-ruxa</link><description>This data contains all indicator data from the PY13-FY15 Preliminary Mayor's Management Reports (meaning all data from performance indicators related to each agency's work, not including budgeting and agency resource data).

It may also offer other devices, services, and digital literacy and digital skills programming, for example. A PCC may be funded in whole, or in part, with public dollars in order to provide a public service (i.e., access to digital inclusion resources). Some PCCs are open to the general public while others may have membership criteria such as age. As an inventory, and as feasible, OTI’s purpose was to collect, count, and map where and how the City supports this kind of public access to the internet.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">sejx-2gn3</guid><category>Social Services</category><pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 13:26:58 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
